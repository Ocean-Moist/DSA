THE SQUARE BETWEEN THE POST OFFICE AND THE BANK AROUND TEN OCLOCK IN SOME TOWNS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THAT THE LOTTERY TOOK TWO DAYS AND HAD TO BE STARTED ON JUNE TH BUT IN THIS VILLAGE WHERE THERE WERE ONLY ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PEOPLE THE WHOLE LOTTERY TOOK ONLY ABOUT TWO HOURS SO IT COULD BEGIN AT TEN OCLOCK IN THE MORNING AND STILL BE THROUGH IN TIME TO ALLOW THE VILLAGERS TO GET HOME FOR NOON DINNER THE CHILDREN ASSEMBLED FIRST OF COURSE SCHOOL WAS RECENTLY OVER FOR THE SUMMER AND THE FEELING OF LIBERTY SAT UNEASILY ON MOST OF THEM THEY TENDED TO GATHER TOGETHER QUIETLY FOR A WHILE BEFORE THEY BROKE INTO BOISTEROUS PLAY AND THEIR TALK WAS STILL OF THE CLASSROOM AND THE TEACHER OF BOOKS AND REPRIMANDS BOBBY MARTIN HAD ALREADY STUFFED HIS POCKETS FULL OF STONES AND THE OTHER BOYS SOON FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE SELECTING THE SMOOTHEST AND ROUNDEST STONES BOBBY AND HARRY JONES AND DICKIE DELACROIX THE VILLAGERS PRONOUNCED THIS NAME DELLACROY EVENTUALLY MADE A GREAT PILE OF STONES IN ONE CORNER OF THE SQUARE AND GUARDED IT AGAINST THE RAIDS OF THE OTHER BOYS THE GIRLS STOOD ASIDE TALKING AMONG THEMSELVES LOOKING OVER THEIR SHOULDERS AT THE BOYS AND THE VERY SMALL CHILDREN ROLLED IN THE DUST OR CLUNG TO THE HANDS OF THEIR OLDER BROTHERS OR SISTERS SOON THE MEN BEGAN TO GATHER SURVEYING THEIR OWN CHILDREN SPEAKING OF PLANTING AND RAIN TRACTORS AND TAXES THEY STOOD TOGETHER AWAY FROM THE PILE OF STONES IN THE CORNER AND THEIR JOKES WERE QUIET AND THEY SMILED RATHER THAN LAUGHED THE WOMEN WEARING FADED HOUSE DRESSES AND SWEATERS CAME SHORTLY AFTER THEIR MENFOLK THEY GREETED ONE ANOTHER AND EXCHANGED BITS OF GOSSIP AS THEY WENT TO JOIN THEIR HUSBANDS SOON THE WOMEN STANDING BY THEIR HUSBANDS BEGAN TO CALL TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN CAME RELUCTANTLY HAVING TO BE CALLED FOUR OR FIVE TIMES BOBBY MARTIN DUCKED UNDER HIS MOTHERS GRASPING HAND AND RAN LAUGHING BACK TO THE PILE OF STONES HIS FATHER SPOKE UP SHARPLY AND BOBBY CAME QUICKLY AND TOOK HIS PLACE BETWEEN HIS FATHER AND HIS OLDEST BROTHER THE LOTTERY WAS CONDUCTED AS WERE THE SQUARE DANCES THE TEENAGE CLUB THE HALLOWEEN PROGRAM BY MR SUMMERS WHO HAD TIME AND ENERGY TO DEVOTE TO CIVIC ACTIVITIES HE WAS A ROUNDFACED JOVIAL MAN AND HE RAN THE COAL BUSINESS AND PEOPLE WERE SORRY FOR HIM BECAUSE HE HAD NO CHILDREN AND HIS WIFE WAS A SCOLD WHEN HE ARRIVED IN THE SQUARE CARRYING THE BLACK WOODEN BOX THERE WAS A MURMUR OF CONVERSATION AMONG THE VILLAGERS AND HE WAVED AND CALLED LITTLE LATE TODAY FOLKS THE POSTMASTER MR GRAVES FOLLOWED HIM CARRYING A THREELEGGED STOOL AND THE STOOL WAS PUT IN THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE AND MR SUMMERS SET THE BLACK BOX DOWN ON IT THE VILLAGERS KEPT THEIR DISTANCE LEAVING A SPACE BETWEEN THEMSELVES AND THE STOOL AND WHEN MR SUMMERS SAID SOME OF YOU FELLOWS WANT TO GIVE ME A HAND THERE WAS A HESITATION BEFORE TWO MEN MR MARTIN AND HIS OLDEST SON BAXTER CAME FORWARD TO HOLD THE BOX STEADY ON THE STOOL WHILE MR SUMMERS STIRRED UP THE PAPERS INSIDE IT THE ORIGINAL PARAPHERNALIA FOR THE LOTTERY HAD BEEN LOST LONG AGO AND THE BLACK BOX NOW RESTING ON THE STOOL HAD BEEN PUT INTO USE EVEN BEFORE OLD MAN WARNER THE OLDEST MAN IN TOWN WAS BORN MR SUMMERS SPOKE FREQUENTLY TO THE VILLAGERS ABOUT MAKING A NEW BOX BUT NO ONE LIKED TO UPSET EVEN AS MUCH TRADITION AS WAS REPRESENTED BY THE BLACK BOX THERE WAS A STORY THAT THE PRESENT BOX HAD BEEN MADE WITH SOME PIECES OF THE BOX THAT HAD PRECEDED IT THE ONE THAT HAD BEEN CONSTRUCTED WHEN THE FIRST PEOPLE SETTLED DOWN TO MAKE A VILLAGE HERE EVERY YEAR AFTER THE LOTTERY MR SUMMERS BEGAN TALKING AGAIN ABOUT A NEW BOX BUT EVERY YEAR THE SUBJECT WAS ALLOWED TO FADE OFF WITHOUT ANYTHINGS BEING DONE THE BLACK BOX GREW SHABBIER EACH YEAR BY NOW IT WAS NO LONGER COMPLETELY BLACK BUT SPLINTERED BADLY ALONG ONE SIDE TO SHOW THE ORIGINAL WOOD COLOR AND IN SOME PLACES FADED OR STAINED MR MARTIN AND HIS OLDEST SON BAXTER HELD THE BLACK BOX SECURELY ON THE STOOL UNTIL MR SUMMERS HAD STIRRED THE PAPERS THOROUGHLY WITH HIS HAND BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE RITUAL HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN OR DISCARDED MR SUMMERS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN HAVING SLIPS OF PAPER SUBSTITUTED FOR THE CHIPS OF WOOD THAT HAD BEEN USED FOR GENERATIONS CHIPS OF WOOD MR SUMMERS HAD ARGUED HAD BEEN ALL VERY WELL WHEN THE VILLAGE WAS TINY BUT NOW THAT THE POPULATION WAS MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED AND LIKELY TO KEEP ON GROWING IT WAS NECESSARY TO USE SOMETHING THAT WOULD FIT MORE EASILY INTO THE BLACK BOX THE NIGHT BEFORE THE LOTTERY MR SUMMERS AND MR GRAVES MADE UP THE SLIPS OF PAPER AND PUT THEM INTO THE BOX AND IT WAS THEN TAKEN TO THE SAFE OF MR SUMMERS COAL COMPANY AND LOCKED UP UNTIL MR SUMMERS WAS READY TO TAKE IT TO THE SQUARE NEXT MORNING THE REST OF THE YEAR THE BOX WAS PUT AWAY SOMETIMES ONE PLACE SOMETIMES ANOTHER IT HAD SPENT ONE YEAR IN MR GRAVES BARN AND ANOTHER YEAR UNDERFOOT IN THE POST OFFICE AND SOMETIMES IT WAS SET ON A SHELF IN THE MARTIN GROCERY AND LEFT THERE THERE WAS A GREAT DEAL OF FUSSING
